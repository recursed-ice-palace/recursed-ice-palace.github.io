It’s very annoying.","Down + Jump = Fall off from a box.","You don’t have to know this, but it will make your life much easier."],["This level is too hard, I need a hint.","Alright, we can give you hints.","Sometimes, to halt the game and start logical deduction helps. But if you still think it’s too hard, feel free to contact us. Or you can just ask for a hint on the forum. We can give you a hint. Also, please feel free to share your hints and solutions! We don’t mind it as long as you take care of the spoilers."],["This level is logically impossible and I can prove it!","You missed something.","Believe me, all gems are collectible. Have you got the diamond in the Void - Escalate? How about the ruby in the Last Tapestry - Flight? Did you think those levels are also impossible at the first glance? Well, I did actually. Or maybe it’s the case which you missed some unusual control tricks, just like some key moves in some maps. Do you remember yourself solving The Void - Grasp? We have found some other original tricks. Some levels are completely built on it, which may seem to be logically impossible to solve until you get the trick. You could solve it when you catch the trick."],["I hate jars.","Good.","Working as intended."],["Bug! Strange behavior!","It doesn’t change anything.","Oobleck in aqua mortua: Wow, you are pretty quick-witted. You reached Low Tide, right? It’s actually a hidden feature that Portponky made. It doesn’t change anything though, we didn’t want to actively use it. Submerged ledge: Portponky was too lazy to make properly working submerged ledge, so they are actually translucent solid blocks. Fear not! We designed levels very carefully to make sure it doesn’t change anything. There were several other non-intuitive behaviors (such as making the second paradox by entering a cauldron, instead of leaving a room) which are really hard to understand, but no puzzle exploits them, so relax."],["Is there any hint for the locations of diamonds/rubies, or at least a number of them?","Yep.","For The Ice Palace - yes, two rooms contain hints. One room shows the total number of each of the gems. Another room shows the exact locations of them. Navigate rooms carefully. For A Day Out - no.

But since we have no way to notice it to you, we will try to update it as least as possible. The current version is v1.0. We have no way to automatically update your game since this DLC is not an official one. You need to manually update it by installing it again."],["How can I remove this DLC?","How sad! You don’t.","Just kidding. In the zip file you downloaded, there’s the uninstall file. Execute “uninstall-Windows.bat” or “uninstall-Mac.sh” depending on your OS, and find your Steam folder. This will remove this DLC without erasing your whole progress.
