// It’s very annoying.",

// "This level is too hard, I need a hint.",
// "Alright, we can give you hints.",
// "Sometimes, to halt the game and start logical deduction helps. \
// But if you still think it’s too hard, feel free to contact us \
// or start a thread in the Steam discussion. \
// Also, please feel free to share your hints and solutions! \
// We don’t mind it as long as you take care of the spoilers.",

// How about the ruby in the Last Tapestry - Flight? Did you think those levels are \
// also impossible at the first glance? Well, I (choongmyoung) did actually. \
// Or maybe it’s the case which you missed some unusual control tricks, \
// just like some key moves in some maps. Do you remember yourself solving The Void - Grasp? \
// We have found some other original tricks. Some levels are completely built on it, \
// which may seem to be logically impossible to solve until you get the trick. \

// It’s actually a hidden feature that Portponky made. It doesn’t change anything though, \
// we didn’t want to actively use it. Submerged ledge: Portponky was too lazy to make properly \
// working submerged ledge, so they are actually translucent solid blocks. Fear not! \
// We designed levels very carefully to make sure it doesn’t change anything. \
// There were several other non-intuitive behaviors (such as making the second paradox \
// by entering a cauldron, instead of leaving a room) which are really hard to understand, \
// but no puzzle exploits them, so relax."

// "Is there any hint for the locations of diamonds/rubies, or at least a number of them?",
// "Yep.",
// "For The Ice Palace - yes, two rooms contain hints. One room shows the total number of \
// each of the gems. Another room shows the exact locations of them. Navigate rooms carefully. \
// For A Day Out - no. We believe you already realized how to distinguish \
// whether a level contains bonus gems or not by now.",

// "Are you going to translate the mission names?",
// "Nah.",
// "We can’t do all the translations job - we know you can read English, \
// ‘cuz this sentence is written in English.",

// [
// "Will this DLC be updated?",
// "Maybe, maybe not.",
// "If more great custom levels are made or we desperately have to remove \
// some unexpected alternative solutions. But since we have no way to notice it to you, \
// we will try to update it as least as possible. The current version is v1.0. \
// We have no way to automatically update your game since this DLC is not an official one. \
// You need to manually update it by installing it again.",
// ],
// [
// "How can I remove this DLC?",
// "How sad! You don’t.",
// "Just kidding. In the zip file you downloaded, there’s the uninstall file. \
// Execute “uninstall-Windows.bat” or “uninstall-Mac.sh” depending on your OS, \
// and find your Steam folder. This will remove this DLC without erasing your whole progress. \
// When you re-install the DLC, your progress will still be there.",
